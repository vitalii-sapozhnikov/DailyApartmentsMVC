# Annotation
The aim of this project is to design and implement an information system for renting apartments for tourists around the world (similar to Airbnb). 
The users of this system are tourists and owners of real estate. This project was implemented using the C# language, namely the ASP.NET web development platform, 
the PostgreSQL database and the Entity Framework Core, which is used by the Npgsql service provider for 
object-relational mapping of SQL components to C# components. 

In addition, the system architecture follows the MVC design pattern.
The developed information system provides for the registration of 
two types of users - the owner and the guest. The owner's functionality includes 
creating an ad, managing booking requests, and viewing 
analytical data on their ads. The guest has the ability to view 
available listings and send requests for booking a property. 
The developed information system is protected against unauthorised access, and 
The system also delineates the powers of different categories of users. 
This approach ensures the integrity, confidentiality and availability of information 
within the system.
